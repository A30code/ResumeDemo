    <br /><br />
    I express my feelings through writing my thoughts, journaling, listining songs and the best part spending time in nature.
    Whenever i spend time with nature wheather I am happy,overwhelmed, excited or whichever mood i am in it kinda heals.
    whenever it rains i love getting wet in rain.Find peace in dark whether, lightning. Also spending time in greenery means surrounded 
    by flowers and trees from all sides.
